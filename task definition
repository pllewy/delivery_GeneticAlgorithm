Task 5
Solve the multi-criteria optimization problem faced by a courier company. We need to deliver parcels. On one hand, we want to deliver them as quickly as possible, and on the other, we want to minimize the cost. Input data:

df -- a dataset of orders with their locations and weights
t -- number of available trucks
p -- a dataset of fuel stations with their locations and price per liter
fp -- a function defining fuel consumption per 100km based on the weight
cp -- fuel tank capacity
b -- base location
s -- average speed in km/h
m -- hourly rate of the driver

At the end, all trucks must return to the base and have at least 50% fuel left in the tank. All parcels must be delivered within the required period. The capacity of the trucks is unlimited. To calculate the distance, use the Manhattan distance, coordinates are given in kilometers. The truck does not need to take the entire load at once; it can return to the base to take more parcels.

Example data:

np.random.seed(42)
n = 100
t = 10
df = pd.DataFrame({"latitude": np.random.randn(n) * 50, 
                   "longitude": np.random.randn(n) * 50, 
                   "mass": np.random.rand(n) * 10})
n = 10
p = pd.DataFrame({"latitude": np.random.randn(n) * 50, 
                  "longitude": np.random.randn(n) * 50, 
                  "price": np.random.rand(n) * 2 + 5})
fp = lambda m: m
cp = 150
b = np.array([0, 0])
s = 40
m = 50
